  "body": "Time for another big update to BluestNight! In this episode, the events system has been overhauled to look nicer and provide more functionality than previously. Also, a some other semantic changes to watch out for while updating. Events Events have been changed from data to content files, to better give visitors information about any events held by the owner of the site. Visitors can now visit pages for previous events and see what is coming past the five most immediate events.Before The previous method of doing events involved data files with information relating to the events. Those data files were then parsed and assembled into an iCalendar file; the five most immediate upcoming events were also put into the sidebar of the website for easy viewing.After The iCalendar file and sidebar reminders are still there, but the sidebar widget has been reformatted slightly to display more information in a clearer fashion. Because events are now content pages, the sidebar widget now also links each event preview to the page for that event.Events now include the following information: Title (same as page title) Start/end date and time &amp;ldquo;Doors open&amp;rdquo; time Location All other page options  The event list page defaults to sorting events by start date, with the latest (greatest date value) listed first.Semantic Changes Another possibly breaking change in BluestNight is the assumption that section names are plural, i.e. /events/ and /posts/. This should only affect the two sections used as examples, as BluestNight doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about the others.In an effort to be backwards-compatible, the home page and recent posts widget will still show content from /post/, though /posts/ will be preferred if found.The reason for this change is to try to align more closely to Hugo&amp;rsquo;s convention of sections and content types being pluralized.Other Changes As well as the above, the page metadata section has seen some love, with the following changes: Metadata labels (&amp;ldquo;Published&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Last Updated&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Estimated Reading Time&amp;rdquo;) have been bolded to provide contrast between them and the metadata itself. &amp;ldquo;Last Updated&amp;rdquo; is only displayed if the .Lastmod date is different from the normal .Date. &amp;ldquo;Estimated Reading Time&amp;rdquo; received its own very special book icon.  Other miscellaneous changes: Member boxes now have the option to remove the top and bottom border. The events sidebar widget displays &amp;ldquo;No upcoming events&amp;rdquo; if there are no upcoming events at build time. The minimum required Hugo version has been increased to 0.28. ",

Paid Accounts Paid pro accounts have some more options available to them, including removing Iubenda branding from the policy button and accessing the policy from a JSON API endpoint. This means that pro users with Hugo can access the text of their privacy policy using Hugo&amp;rsquo;s getJSON template function and have it appear directly on a page - this is how BluestNight&amp;rsquo;s privacy policy page is put together, using the new {{&amp;lt; iubenda &amp;gt;}} shortcode. Just make an empty page at content/privacy-policy.md (see the previous announcement) and include that shortcode. The shortcode will use the Iubenda information from your configuration file and fill the page with the policy text.Iubenda also includes cookie consent banner support for paid accounts. BluestNight currently provides basic theme integration for the banner and some of its options, with untested support for requiring prior consent before loading scripts that set cookies.New Typewriter Font As part of trying to provide useful fonts in different styles, BluestNight now comes with a typewriter font, called Secret Typewriter.There have been some questions asked in the Hugo Forums and in BluestNight issues regarding why I include font files and don&amp;rsquo;t just enable people to specify some Google Fonts URL for the font they want to use. The main reason is one of independence: I don&amp;rsquo;t think a website should be pulling resources from third parties whenever possible. Third parties are not under your own control and may shut down, go down, or otherwise become temporarily or permanently unaccessible, leaving your website crippled.Fonts are especially important in this, since the use of a different font changes the look and even the feel of the website. Even falling back to the system default sans-serif font can cause the site to look unsettlingly different, though the change itself seems minor. So, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that fonts for the website using BluestNight should be downloaded from the same server as the page itself.That said, I do want to provide some creative ability in the use of different kinds of fonts, hence the inclusion of multiple handwriting fonts and the new inclusion of the typewriter font. Click the previous link to see a preview of the typewriter font in use.Optimizations A number of optimizations have been applied to BluestNight as well, including the use of cached partials to greatly descrease site build times and the use of preloading in the generated pages to load resources quicker.All Changes  BluestNight website moved to a new repo [045d6cbb] Pull static functionality into a partial and add support for links with # ids [3c052b6b] Fix transparency issue in Chromium browsers [982fe603] Added Iubenda support [3a1ce6e0] Added Iubenda Pro support [75b48e20] Increase page max-width [98350e0c] Fix nested ordered lists not being indented [346e847b] Improve site compilation by caching certain partials [984a0e0f] Switch to CDNJS for hosting of minified Lunr.js and leverage browser preloading for scripts and stylesheets [a6d9d11c] Add new typewriter font with shortcode and simplify font shortcodes [8ca7f80a] Preload images from articles [768c850e] Prevent images from being broken across printed pages (Firefox not compatible) [0503da0d] Improve Iubenda integration for free accounts by making the Terms of Use footer link look like the Iubenda button [e5d4c2e8] Remove excess whitespace on some generated pages [50b487e3] Add Iubenda prior consent support for the cookie banner  ",

  "body": "On March 20th, 2017, I made the first commit in the BluestNight repository. Back then, BluestNight was little more than my attempt to create a cleaner-written version of the Mainroad theme after I grew frustrated with maintaining the fork I made, named &amp;ldquo;Darkroad&amp;rdquo; (it was a dark version of Mainroad).The first iteration of BluestNight was built using the Foundation CSS framework by Zurb. It worked well for quickly building the skeleton of the theme, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never been one for using frameworks when I don&amp;rsquo;t actually need them. So, after learning about the existence of the flex box CSS model, I decided to scrap Foundation in favor of a few custom classes using flex.I had also implemented custom color support from the beginning, using a static CSS file combined with inlined CSS overrides at the top of every page. This worked well enough, except for when the override didn&amp;rsquo;t actually override the base setting (because the base rule was more specific than the override). That changed when Hugo 0.20.0 was released on April 10th with custom output format support - now I could generate the CSS with custom colors from the beginning, no overrides needed!All of the features in BluestNight are either (a) features I use or (b) alternatives to the features I use for people wanting something different. The nice thing about this is that most features available in BluestNight get used on a site that I maintain, which helps greatly with catching bugs before changes get published. Being a user of the features myself, I also have a better idea of what a user would want from this theme, and I think it shows.Anyhow, BluestNight has graduated from being &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; a personal project. It&amp;rsquo;s still developed almost solely by me, but it&amp;rsquo;s become more than &amp;ldquo;that theme I made&amp;rdquo; - enough so that I decided to make a BluestNight group on GitLab (equivalent to a GitHub organization). This decision was also in part due to my plans to create a utility to help people maintain their Hugo websites, including support for various themes (more on that in a future update).BluestNight is still the same great theme you love - or maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve yet to love it. In that case, take some time to look around, check out the documentation, see what you think. If you like it, why not support development of this theme on Patreon? Building a theme like this is a lot of work, which is hard when you spend your time instead doing work that pays you. Even a dollar or two per month helps.If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in staying up to date with BluestNight development, why don&amp;rsquo;t you subscribe to updates using your favorite RSS reader?

In the above example, the file would be found at {site root}/static/images/background.png. Optionally set medium_src and small_src to smaller images to use on screens that are at most 1024px and 640px, respectively. If either of these are omitted, the next largest image source will be used. Set fit_width to true if you want the behavior of CSS background-size: contain and false if you want the behavior of background-size: cover  Custom Colors Add the following to your site&amp;rsquo;s config.toml file:[Params.color] page_background = &amp;quot;#000000&amp;quot; main_background = &amp;quot;#050505&amp;quot; alt_background = &amp;quot;#252525&amp;quot; main_text = &amp;quot;#e2e2e2&amp;quot; alt_text = &amp;quot;#e2e2e2&amp;quot; accent = &amp;quot;#2c8cef&amp;quot; accent_text = &amp;quot;#e2e2e2&amp;quot;  The above values represent the default colors in the theme. Modify them as you&amp;rsquo;d like. page_background is the background color for what is &amp;ldquo;behind&amp;rdquo; the page. This is the same area as where the background image is applied, so it is a good idea to pick a color that matches the image if you use fit_width = true on the background image. main_background is the background color for most of the content page. alt_background is the alternate background color for the page. This background is applied to the navigation bar, footer, various buttons, and as the alternate color for zebra-striped tables. main_text is the font color that corresponds with main_background. alt_text is the font color that corresponds with alt_background. accent is the color applied to the site header, links, and buttons that are hovered over or marked active. accent_text is the font color that is used when accent is being used as the background color.  Font Customization BluestNight uses the following font families: Clear Sans (sans-serif) Zilla Slab (serif) Source Code Pro (monospace)  By default, Clear Sans is used for all text on the on the web page except for &amp;lt;code&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; blocks, which use Source Code Pro, and any text inside of the custom font shortcodes. Zilla Slab is used by default for text when a page is printed.These defaults can be modified, though, through the use of four configuration properties and two shortcodes.[Params.fonts] header_style = &amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot; body_style = &amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot; print_header_style = &amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot; print_body_style = &amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;  The above code block shows the default values of each of the four configuration properties and how they would appear inside on a configuration file written in TOML. Properties prefixed with print_ affect printed pages only, while those without affect only the page on a screen. The header_style properties set the font family for all page headers, while the body_style ones affect the main text of the page (inside the &amp;lt;article&amp;gt; tag, for the web developers).If header_style and body_style (or print_header_style and print_body_style) match, the choice of &amp;ldquo;serif&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;sans-serif&amp;rdquo; is applied to the entire page. If they do not match, text in the footer and sidebar is ignored, unless it is a header. If you want to change the font family for a block of text on a page, you can use the {{% serif %}} and {{% sans-serif %}} shortcodes.Examples {{% serif %}} This text will **always** be *serif*. {{% /serif %}}  This text will always be serif. {{% sans-serif %}} This text will **always** be *sans-serif*. {{% /sans-serif %}}  This text will always be sans-serif.

  "body": "BluestNight provides a number of ways for you to customize list pages using _index.md files.Custom content If you create an _index.md file for a list page and put content in it, that content will appear above the list on the generated page.Hide the list Maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t want to display the list of pages, just your custom content. Set hide_list to true in the front matter of the _index.md file and BluestNight will only generate the custom content on that page.Show nested sections Sections onlyIf you want to display the nested sections under the one a list page represents, set list_subsections to true in the page&amp;rsquo;s front matter. The list will not be displayed if hide_list is set to true.Sort/filter listed pages By default, BluestNight (and Hugo) sort the pages under a section or taxonomy by date, with the newest page first. You have the ability to choose what page field to sort by and in ascending or descending order. You also have the ability to filter only pages with the file name index.md.Custom sort field To sort the entries in the list, set the values of sort_field and (optionally) sort_order in the list page&amp;rsquo;s front matter. Valid values for sort_field are any ordering page variable without the leading By OR any front matter variable with the prefix Params. If the template sorting method you want to use in the Hugo docs is ByDate, sort_field should be &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;. If sorting by the custom front matter parameter sorting_weight, sort_field should be &amp;quot;Params.sorting_weight&amp;quot; (note the lack of a leading . on Params).  Custom sort order Valid values for sort_order are &amp;quot;asc&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;desc&amp;quot;. If sort_order is not specified, the order will depend on what makes the most sense for that field. sort_order is ignored if sort_field is not specified. Date fields are descending (new first) by default. Title and Weight fields are ascending (A-Z and 1-9) by default. Sort fields beginning with Params are also ascending by default and cannot currently be changed.  To sort the pages in a custom order, you can set a variable in the front matter, for example sort_weight, and number the pages in the order you want them to appear in.+++ # file name: _index.md title = &amp;quot;List page&amp;quot; sort_field = &amp;quot;Params.sort_weight&amp;quot; +++ +++ # file name: first.md title = &amp;quot;First article&amp;quot; sort_weight = 1 +++ +++ # file name: second.md title = &amp;quot;Second article&amp;quot; sort_weight = 2 +++  Filter only index.md To display only those pages with the file name index.md, set index_only to true in the list page&amp;rsquo;s front matter. You may want to use this if a section contains folders of content that are not subsections of this one (i.e. have a file _index.md), but only want to list the entry pages of those folders.+++ index_only = true +++  Examples This site author wants to display a message to their readers before showing the most recent posts.+++ # Found under &amp;quot;post/_index.md&amp;quot; title = &amp;quot;My Awesome Posts&amp;quot; hide_list = false +++ Before you get to my posts, I just want you all to know how much I appreciate your readership and your feedback on my posts.  This site author provides a multi-page how-to guide and wants users to start with a link to the first item so they don&amp;rsquo;t skip ahead.+++ # Found under &amp;quot;how-to/install-linux/_index.md&amp;quot; title = &amp;quot;How to Install Linux&amp;quot; hide_list = true # Won&#39;t show any other pages under &amp;quot;how-to/install-linux&amp;quot; +++ If you&#39;ve ever wanted to install a Linux distribution on your computer but weren&#39;t sure how, this guide is for you!

  "body": "You have a list of events you want to share with your reader base - why not display them on your site?BluestNight provides both a sidebar widget to display the 5 earliest occurring events listed and a template for a .ics calendar file that readers can subscribe to.Setup Create a new content file in the events section of your site. The easiest way to do this is to use the hugo new command:hugo new events/some-event.md  Hugo should automatically populate the front matter of the file with the appropriate variables: title: The title of the event (and its related page). location: The location of the event. start_date: The starting datetime of the event. end_date: The ending datetime of the event. doors_open: The datetime representing when the doors open (where start_date represents when people can start lining up for the doors).  To enable events on your site, set upcoming_events to true under Params.widgets in your sites configuration folder:# In config.toml [Params.widgets] upcoming_events = true  Limitations  Items do not automatically disappear from the sidebar  BluestNight automatically filters out events that have already passed when adding events to the sidebar, but it cannot dynamically remove them as they pass, due to it being a static site. It is on the site administrator to at least rebuild the site after an event has passed, though I suggest considering removing the data file as well.  ",

  "body": "(Examples use a file at /static/path/to/image.jpg)There&amp;rsquo;s a limitation with the way links are created in markdown. In order to link to static files in content files, we need to either: Write a path relative to the current directory, with ../ and the like, so a file at content/section/subsection/page.md would need ../../../path/to/image.jpg Prefix the path with a leading /, which causes the path to resolve to example.com/path/to/image.jpg  The first is a pain to have to do, and the second only works if the baseURL of your Hugo site is example.com. A site at example.com/subdir/ will still resolve the link to example.com/path/to/image.jpg, which won&amp;rsquo;t exist.To get around this limitation (at least until it gets implemented in Hugo), BluestNight includes a shortcode called static that will correctly resolve links to static files according to the site&amp;rsquo;s baseURL. The syntax is similar to the ref and relref shortcodes:![Image alt text]({{&amp;lt; static &amp;quot;path/under/static/folder/file.jpg&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}) [Link text]({{&amp;lt; static &amp;quot;other/static/folder/file.txt&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})  Example output, using a baseURL of http://example.com/subdir/:&amp;lt;imgsrc=&amp;#34;http://example.com/subdir/path/under/static/folder/file.jpg&amp;#34;alt=&amp;#34;Image alt text&amp;#34;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ahref=&amp;#34;http://example.com/subdir/other/static/folder/file.txt&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Link text&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; ",

See here for a list of valid HTML &amp;lt;input&amp;gt; types.BluestNight makes a few changes to the above list of input types for this shortcode. First, textarea is considered a valid input type, equivalent to the HTML &amp;lt;textarea&amp;gt; element, which is a multiline text entry field. Second, all &amp;ldquo;button&amp;rdquo; types are considered invalid, as the form automatically includes buttons to submit and clear the form. These invalid types are: button: A standard button image: A button made from an image submit: Submits the form reset: Clears the form, allowing the user to start over  If you enter an invalid input type, BluestNight will render a small warning where the input element should be.Required parameters: type: A valid input type from the above link. id: A unique identifier for the input field. Must be unique across input elements in all forms on the page. accept: Only for type=&amp;quot;file&amp;quot; inputs. Specify valid file types to submit. See here for what valid values look like.  Optional parameters: placeholder: Placeholder text to appear inside the element as an example of valid input. minlength/maxlength: Set the minimum and/or maximum character length for the input. regex: A regular expression that valid input must match. Use types email, url, date, or time if you want to validate against one of those. value: Set a default value in the input field. Not recommended unless you have good reason. required: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if this input field is required. Numeric and Datetime inputs (number, range, date)  min: The minimum value allowed. See more. max: The maximum value allowed. See more. step: If specified, indicates that the value of the input must be equal to min + n * step, where n is an integer. See more.  file and email type inputs  multiple: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if more than one file or email address can be entered in this field.   mult-input The mult-input shortcode acts as a wrapper around multiple related radio or checkbox elements.Required parameters: type: radio or select for when only one selection can be made and checkbox for multiple selections. name: A unique identifier for the input field. Must be unique across input elements in all forms on the page. label: A label for the group of radio buttons or checkboxes  Optional parameters: add_other: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; to add an &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; option to the end of the list with an accompanying textbox below it. required: For radio and select types. &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; if a selection is required.  form-option The form-option shortcode indicates one of a group of related options under a mult-input.Required parameters: label: A label for this particular option. value: The value returned from the form when this option is selected. Is not displayed to the end user.  Optional parameters: selected: &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; for this option to be selected by default.

To enable this feature, set enable_cookie_policy to true and site_id to the site ID displayed in the consent banner embed code. Consent Banner Embed Code  The &amp;#39;siteId&amp;#39; parameter corresponds with BluestNight&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;site_id&amp;#39;, while &amp;#39;cookiePolicyId&amp;#39; corrsponds with BluestNight&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;id&amp;#39; parameter.   Iubenda Pro offers the ability to prevent tracking scripts from loading until the user accepts the cookie policy, free up to 25,000 monthly page views. It also, however, offers a &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo; cookie solution that does not prevent tracking scripts from loading and is always free. Note that Iubenda warns that prior consent - blocking tracking until the user consents - is required by &amp;ldquo;most EU legislations&amp;rdquo; and thus the &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; solution is recommended.To choose between the two solutions, change the prior_consent parameter. A value of true enables the &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; solution and false enables the &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo; version.Iubenda Shortcode Pro accounts also have the ability to access the privacy policy over a JSON api endpoint. What this means for BluestNight users is that Hugo can download the contents of the privacy policy once while building the site, rather than loading the text using JavaScript every time the page is loaded.The recommended way to do this is to create the privacy-policy.md file in the root of your content directory and use the shortcode in place of any page content.

After &amp;ldquo;table&amp;rdquo; comes a list of column names in the order that they should appear, from left to right. {{&amp;lt; table-row &amp;gt;}} serves as a container for {{% table-row %}} and does not take any parameters. {{% table-row %}} takes content in between the opening and closing tags. There should be a number of {{% table-row %}} tags equal to the number of column names, and values should appear in the same order as their labels do.  Known Limitations  {{&amp;lt; table &amp;gt;}} and {{&amp;lt; table-row &amp;gt;}} must use the {{&amp;lt;&amp;gt;}} syntax for shortcodes. Using {{%%}} will cause the inner HTML to display inside a code block instead or rendering on the page. {{% table-row %}} can use either, though {{%%}} is recommended so you can use markdown inside of the cell. {{% table-cell %}} tags must be on the same line as content, or else an issue occurs similar to the one above. Reference style markdown links (via ref, relref, and static shortcodes) cannot be used inside of {{% table-cell %}} tags. Inline link syntax ([link text](url)) works fine. The shortcodes do not support colspan, rowspan, &amp;lt;caption&amp;gt;, or table footers. Then again, neither do markdown tables&amp;hellip;  ",
